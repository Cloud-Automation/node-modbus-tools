    // is established

    loop.on('loopUpdate', function (regs, diffTime) {
        
        // in the registers you can get the requested values
        // in the loopHoldingRegister call earlier

        // the diffTime parameter indicates how much
        // time is left till the next loop
        // if the loop took longer than the
        // loopDuration value then diffTime will be 0
